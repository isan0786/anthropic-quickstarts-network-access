# anthropic-quickstarts-network-access
Modified version of `ghcr.io/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts:computer-use-demo-latest` to enable network-wide access. Dynamically replaces `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` with the host machine's IP address, allowing users to connect to the application from any IP address within the same network.
